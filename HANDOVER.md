# Handover

Hi folks!

Firstly, my apologies for how long this took! Thank you for trusting me with this and hopefully it meets your
satisfaction. If it doesn't, scrap it! Change what you need to, at the end of the day this should serve OWD visitors
first and foremost, their needs take priority.

Secondly, I've put together this short doc to include handover info & stuff to note.

## Stuff

1. There are a number of TODO items in the codebase for you to have a look at, mainly stuff I don't have info for.
   1. `contribute/conference-organiser.html` includes a link intended for an email, you'll need to fill in w/ the
      OWD contact email.
   2. `contribute/individual-contributor` includes a link that's intended to point to somewhere folks can either
      find out more about contributing or the GH issues. There's been a lot of discussion of where this should lead
      to without any decisions (that I'm aware of) - were we still waiting for MDN contribution hub?
   3. `README` includes a section on contributing (if you want to allow that), and needs to be filled in.
2. Membership has launched but there wasn't any copy for it, so it isn't on the site - you'll likely want to add it.
3. Delete this file :)
